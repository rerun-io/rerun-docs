Rerun currently works with both [Python](getting-started/python) and [Rust](getting-started/rust).
If you are looking for other language support, please check out the TODO(jleibs): Link to github ticket
for the latest status.

Regardless of what language you plan to use with Rerun, the best way to get started is the
[Quick Tour](getting-started/quick-tour). 

Many of our [examples](getting-started/examples) and [how-to guides](how-to-guides) currently utilize python. Even for
Rust users, these examples are a good way to get a sense of how Rerun works and how you might use it in your own
project.
