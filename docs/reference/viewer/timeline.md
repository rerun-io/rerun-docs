Timeline controls
--------------------------

The timeline controls sit at the top of the timeline panel and allow you to control the playback and what [timeline](concepts/timelines) is active.

It lets you select which timeline is currently active and control the replay of the timeline.
These controls let you stop play/pause/step/loop time just like a video player.
When looping you can choose to loop through the whole recording, or just a sub-section of timeline that you select.
The rate of playback can also be sped up or slowed down by adjusting the rate multiplier.

On the left side you see circles for each logged [event](concepts/timelines.md) on the currently selected timeline over time.
You can use the mouse to scrub the vertical time selector line to jump to arbitrary moments in time.
The stream view allows panning & zooming 

The tree on the left shows you all Entities that were logged for this timeline.
